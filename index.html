<p data-start="907" data-end="1350">Bolt has rapidly grown beyond being just a ride-hailing app: it offers food delivery, scooter rentals and car-sharing operations across dozens of countries. The company is now preparing for its IPO, backed by strong fundraising rounds and a &euro;220 million credit facility to bolster its readiness. Even though the exact listing date and venue are still under review, the company is weighing options including London, Amsterdam or U.S. markets.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="2131" data-end="2148"><strong data-start="2131" data-end="2146">Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<ul data-start="2149" data-end="2452">
<li data-start="2149" data-end="2242">
<p data-start="2151" data-end="2242">Historically fewer large tech IPOs compared to the U.S., making investor momentum weaker.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="2243" data-end="2372">
<p data-start="2245" data-end="2372">Some European markets (e.g., London) have seen weaker performance for tech listings, raising questions about long-term value.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="2373" data-end="2452">
<p data-start="2375" data-end="2452">Liquidity and secondary trading may be more constrained than in U.S. markets.</p>

</ul>
<h3 data-start="2454" data-end="2488">U.S.: Strengths &amp; Weaknesses</h3>
<p data-start="2489" data-end="2505"><strong data-start="2489" data-end="2503">Strengths:</strong></p>

<p data-start="2671" data-end="2729">Greater media spotlight and brand visibility for listings.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="2943" data-end="3160">Bolt&rsquo;s leadership appears cautious: its CEO has publicly expressed reservations about a London listing, indicating a belief that some European public markets have struggled to deliver long-term value for tech firms.</p>
<hr data-start="3162" data-end="3165" />
<h2 data-start="3167" data-end="3210">Why the Listing Venue Matters for Bolt</h2>
<ul data-start="3211" data-end="3778">
<li data-start="3211" data-end="3341">
<p data-start="3213" data-end="3341"><strong data-start="3213" data-end="3236">Valuation dynamics:</strong> A larger, more tech-savvy investor base (as in the U.S.) could help secure a higher opening valuation.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="3342" data-end="3488">
<p data-start="3344" data-end="3488"><strong data-start="3344" data-end="3364">Operational fit:</strong> Being headquartered in Europe, Bolt may benefit from investor familiarity and regulatory alignment if it lists in Europe.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="3489" data-end="3634">
<p data-start="3491" data-end="3634"><strong data-start="3491" data-end="3525">Future growth and credibility:</strong> A strong listing tracks record can boost future funding, acquisitions, talent attraction and partnerships.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="3635" data-end="3778">
<p data-start="3637" data-end="3778"><strong data-start="3637" data-end="3677">Exit and secondary-market liquidity:</strong> Tech investors often care about the ability to trade publicly&mdash;stronger in U.S. markets historically.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="3780" data-end="4020">For tech watchers who admire thought-leadership from analysts like Dylan Patel decoding the semiconductor revolution, this decision is a reminder that capital markets are as much about architecture and infrastructure as chips or mobility.</p>

Just like Dylan Patel has illuminated the complexities behind the semiconductor revolution, this moment reveals that for tech companies, the journey to public capital is just as strategic as the product they build.</p>
